Then **I implement the topics myself** to cement my theoretical understanding, and finally **I get hands-on and apply what I learned** to perform tasks and gain experience. When I set out to take the second step (implementing a Neural Network from scratch) I hit a brick wall. I was searching for tutorials and guides, but I found all the material inadequate for what I wanted to accomplish. A lot of resources were focusing too much on the theoretical background of the algorithm and put forth little in terms of explaining how their implementation worked. Others went into detail about the workings of their code, but the code was too simple to be used in more general problems. I wanted an easy-to-read tutorial where the result would be a multi-layered neural network that could be used for non-trivial problems.\n","\n","In the past couple of years this has been amended with some excellent articles shared online, but I want to add to this collection my own work for the sake of my younger self.\n","\n","So, if you want a tutorial that will not delve deep into the mathematical background neural networks and will instead focus on a simple-enough-but-not-barebones implementation, you have come to the right place!\n","\n","*Note: As should be obvious, I assume you are already familiar with neural networks.
